## How to give the input in non-interative way so that jenkins like tools could also be integrated ?
    
      Write Code in python file(a.py): 
      
                                  import sys
                                  a = sys.argv()
                                  print("you name is: " a[1])
                                  
                                  vim Docekrfile
                                    COPY          a.py  /
                                   
                                    ENTRYPOINT    [ "python3", "/a.py" ]
                                  
                                    CMD           [ "usrname" ]
                                    
                                  docker build -t <image>:<tag> <location_of_dockerfile>
                                  
                                  docker run -it <image>:<tag> vimal
                                  
                                  
NOTE:  The option passed(vimal) in terminal with command would override the option written in CMD Keyword(usrname).
